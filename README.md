Focus-

If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your first 6 months at CM, where would you choose to focus your efforts?
For me , I think first six months or first year is most important times. Because I'm junior level develper don't have many experiment, and there lot project I can't handle by myself. I think first six months is about to learning everything and add more experment when you working some project. What am I will foucus is more about framework, like React, Angular. Because the only experiment I have is on the Mthree Training program. Because college will not teach you any framework, so I need learn it by myself. So, If given the time and resources to build/learn anything I wanted during your first 6 months at CM I think the first choice is about to learn the framewrok like React or Angularand and do the any task about using it.  Let me being profession in the FrontEnd. But also have  chance to do and learn about backend stuff. During this time I will try my best to learn everything I can. And developers like senior learn how to write better and more efficient code. All in all I am eager to get this opportunity and to become a better developer during this time.
